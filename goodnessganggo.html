            <h1>Goodness Gang Go Series </h1>
            <h2>A Goodness Gang Collect-a-thon </h2>

            <p>

                TCC and Zappar worked in collaboration to bring augmented reality to the Goodness Gang IP. 
                Through the Goodness Gang Go app series, users were able to scan specially marked codes in retail space to collect digital versions of their favourite Goodness Gang characters.

              </p><p>

                With each newly scanned character, users were able to unlock a fun new game. By playing games and earning points, users were able to spend their rewards on customizing their own in-game avatar and personal garden.

                </p><p>

                Although originally coined the "Goodness Gang Go" project, the app actually took various forms and names across retail markets in Europe (Vitaminis in Netherlands, Goodness Gang Go in Ireland, Gang Świeżaków in Poland, etc.) For each market, retailers were able to release a unique version of the app tailored for their promotional campaign, each featuring different characters, games, language, and branding.
                
                  
            </p>
            <p>
             The app series has proven to be a large success with more than a hundred thousand downloads on the Play and App Store.

             <h2>Creating the App </h2>

           <p>
                    The Goodness Gang Go app series was perhaps one of the most ambitious projects of the time. Rather than building one core app translated for different regions, each partner was to receive a different app with a different cast of characters, games, and cosmetic changes to suit their in-store campaigns. In a sense, we were actually building multiple apps with a common infrastructure.
                  </p><p>
                    As can probably be guessed from its name, the idea for the Goodness Gang Go app originated from the popularity of Pokemon Go. Similarly to Pokemon, the main aim of the app is to collect all the game characters. Unlike Pokemon Go, however, characters and mini-games were unlocked by scanning codes printed on store promotions and merchandise, ranging from cuddly toys to in-store floor mats depending on the partner and campaign.
                </p><p>
                    The initial concept for Goodness Gang Go involved the user 'upgrading' the Goodness Gang members themselves. We decided to rethink this idea and introduce the concept of an avatar character whose garden and wardrobe could be upgraded by unlocking characters and playing games. The avatars were designed in-house, which in itself was a delightful collaborative effort from everyone.
                  </p><p>
                    Although the Goodness Gang are a pre-established franchise, the actual characters vary greatly in design, style, and gender depending on the iteration and market. Our design and 3D team had to collaborate closely with the client to restyle the characters for the app. There is certainly a Disney-esque inspiration in the final characters, one which makes them quite unique and expressive.
                 </p><p>
                    Perhaps most challenging of all, the team had the task of creating a large number of mini-games for the user to unlock. We worked closely with the client to propose kid-friendly concepts that could range from frantic fun to educational. In order to evenly balance each games rewards, we created a 'conversion' step of sorts: at the end of a round, the user's game points would enter an animated blender that would turn them into currency points to be used in the main app. We were pleased by the result as it gave more freedom for our game designs.
